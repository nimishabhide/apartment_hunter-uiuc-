# apartment_hunter-uiuc-
Made this project to scrape data from different websites for apartments and help understand the price range one should be looking out for finding an apartment near UIUC.
Used websites like Zillow,apartments.com and hotpads to scrape data for evaluation.
Have uploaded clean data and numeric data csv files which were used for this evaluation. 
Used this website to find the best regressor that fits the data-https://regclass.herokuapp.com/
Have used both multiple regressor and XGBoost for prediction.
I have used two different styles for using regressor.
The random forest algorithm turns out to be the best.
I have used AWS service (RDS) for storage of data from where I will be extracting data to create a dashboard on Tableau.
